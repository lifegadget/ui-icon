## Dependencies ##

FontAwesome is the sole dependency for this repo to work but it was designed to play nicely with Twitter's Bootstrap as well.

## Version Compatibility

This may very well work with older version of Ember and Ember-CLI but it was intended for:

- Ember 1.11.0+
- Ember-CLI 0.2.2+

## Repo Contribution

We're open to your creative suggestions but please move past the "idea" stage 
and send us a PR so we can incorporate your ideas without killing ourselves. :)
