# [ui-icon](https://github.com/lifegadget/ui-icon) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lifegadget/ui-icon.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lifegadget/ui-icon) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ui-icon.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/ui-icon)  [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/lifegadget/ui-icon/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/lifegadget/ui-icon)
> FontAwesome icons with Ember flare

## Install ##

````bash
ember install ui-icon
````

> Note: in versions 0.9.0+ we have moved a simpler "positional" syntax and therefore have removed the old "shortcuts" which were barely a shortcut at all anymore.

## Usage ##

````hbs
  Full Syntax
  {{ui-icon 'facebook-square'}}
````

For more details on the syntax check out the interactive demo:

## Configuration ##

By default this addon will add all the font and CSS requirements for [**font-awesome**](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/). You might say, "hey that's perfect" and of course that's what we *thought* you'd say so that is our default. You may, however, go whatever path you choose ... you reckless sailor.

### FontAwesome ###

If you've already loaded the CSS/Fonts for FontAwesome and you'd like us to stay out of that business, modify your `ember-cli-build.js` like so:

```javascript
// path/to/app/ember-cli-build.js
var app = new EmberApp({
  'ui-icon': {
    'fa': false
  }
});
```

Ok, the addon will still be inserting `fa` and `fa-[fontName]` classes based on your usage but if you want you can also specify a "font-family", so for instance:

````handlebars
 {{ui-icon family='glyph' icon='file'}}
````

this should then output the classes: `glyph` and `glyph-file` instead of the typical `fa` and `fa-file`. Happy? If not then please turn yourself in ... you are officially miserable.

### Logs ###
By default, this addon will briefly communicate its configuration setup when either `ember serve` or `ember build` is run. This is to remind you of the configuration but if this is unwanted verbosity you can turn it off with:

````javascript
// in your path/to/app/ember.js

var app = new EmberApp({
  'ui-icon': {
    'quiet': true
  }
});
````

## Dependencies ##

- FontAwesome - this is the fountain of icon-awesomeness

## Version Compatibility

This may very well work with older version of Ember and Ember-CLI but it was intended for:

- Ember 1.13.0+
- Ember-CLI 1.13.0+

## Repo Contribution

We are open to your creative suggestions but please move past the "idea" stage
and send us a PR so we can incorporate your ideas without killing ourselves. :)
